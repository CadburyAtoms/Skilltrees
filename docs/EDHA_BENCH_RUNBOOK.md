# EDHA Bench Runbook — the agent-driven bench (2026-07-26)

How a Claude session runs the in-Foundry bench itself, through the in-app browser at
`http://localhost:30000`, instead of leaving every row for Ben. Approved by Ben 2026-07-26
("Could you take control of the PC and do the Foundry tests yourself?" — yes, via browser).
Sessions still **cannot launch Foundry** — everything here requires Ben to have it running.

## One-time setup (Ben)

- Foundry running on port 30000 with the **edha** world launched.
- A **Gamemaster user named `Bench`** exists (created 2026-07-26). ⚠️ **Its password must be
  BLANK** — the agent is not permitted to type passwords into login fields, ever, even
  user-supplied ones. User Management → Bench → clear the password.
- Ben stays logged in as himself (a user's session is single-login; the dedicated user exists
  so the agent never collides with Ben's). Ben can watch everything live.

## Per-run checklist (the agent)

1. **Join:** browser pane → `http://localhost:30000/join` → select **Bench** → Join (no
   password). If Bench shows as already active, STOP and ask Ben to free the session.
2. **Health check** (console via javascript_tool), screenshot as the run header:
   `game.world.id === "edha"`, `game.modules.get("edha-content")?.active`, `!!globalThis.edha`,
   `game.system.version`. Mismatch → stop, report.
3. **Setup:** run `scripts/bench-setup-console.js` in the console. Verify the summary log
   (⚠ lines = talents/paths not found — fix the script, don't improvise). Run it a SECOND time
   and confirm idempotency (no new creations). **View** the scene "Edha Bench — Arena" — never
   *activate* it (activation yanks every connected client, including Ben's).
4. **Run order:** `BENCH — Engine-wide` first — if **2bA-7** (the edit-round-trip) fails, stop
   the whole run and report; everything rides on it. Then White → Blue → Black → Red → Green,
   the ten deities, Heroic, then whatever non-tree sections are console-runnable.
5. **Per row:** select the section's bench PC token → target via
   `game.user.targets` API (`token.setTarget(true, {releaseOthers: true})`) → trigger by the
   row's own verb (sheet click for UI rows; `actor.items.getName("X").use()` for mechanics) →
   read the outcome off `#chat-log` (read_page) + assert actor/status state in the console →
   screenshot the card for evidence. Combat-timing rows: create a Combat on the bench scene,
   run it, and **delete that combat afterward**.
6. **Multi-client rows:** a second browser tab as an unused *player* user MAY displace the
   Bench cookie session. If it does: run those rows as a separate player-phase (rejoin as
   Bench after), or leave them ⚑ for Ben's two-client bench. Never join as a user Ben uses.
7. **Recording (per run, one commit):**
   - **PASS (mechanical):** the row is retired — deleted from `EDHA_FOUNDRY_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
     and named (with its 2b id) in that run's single dated handoff delta, one line of evidence
     each ("card text quoted / status applied and expired / screenshot in session transcript").
   - **FAIL / PARTIAL:** the row stays open with a dated inline observation appended; the
     batch becomes the next `test-pass-fixes` input. Do NOT symptom-patch mid-run.
   - **Feel/design rows, canvas-precision rows** (template placement feel, vision nuance),
     and anything needing Ben's judgment stay ⚑ untouched for Ben.
   - Then: rebuild the dashboard, run the gates, commit (`Bench run N (<tree>): X retired on
     evidence, Y fails -> test-pass-fixes`).
8. **Safety rules (hard):**
   - Only create/modify inside the "Edha Bench" folders. Adversaries needed as targets are
     imported FRESH from the pack into the bench folder — never Ben's placed campaign tokens.
   - No deletion of any pre-existing document; the only combats deleted are bench-created.
   - No world-settings changes, no scene activation, DEPLOY STATE untouched (agent findings
     go in the delta; only Ben advances DEPLOY STATE).
   - Chat spam is accepted (Ben's call, 07-26); end the run noting Ben may flush bench chat.
   - Before/after sweep: snapshot document ids (actors/scenes/combats/macros) at run start and
     end; anything outside the bench folders changed = report it in the delta, prominently.
9. **Pilot rule:** the first run executes ONE tree (Red — smallest live surface, the
   migration's pipe-cleaner talents) end-to-end through recording, delta, dashboard, commit —
   then scale to multi-tree runs.

## Known limits

- The `Bench Target — Undefended` fixture is adversary-typed with only a Physical defense; if
  the engine reads schema defaults as "written" Cognitive/Spiritual, import a pack adversary
  that genuinely lacks them and note it here.
- Wall/vision rows need walls drawn at the table (the Arena ships none) — draw a temporary
  wall on the bench scene, test, delete it (bench-created, so deletion is allowed).
- Rows needing a linked PLAYER client (belief loops, whisper visibility) follow §6; when the
  cookie displacement bites, they are ⚑ Ben rows.
